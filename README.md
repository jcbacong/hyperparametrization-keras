Sample for keras implemntation of hyperparametrization using hyperopt for MLP regression model.
This block of code also demonstrates how to save trained model in json and h5 formats.

Training dataset: energydata.csv
Test file: energytest.csv

To train the MLP and save the model: ```>> python main.py```

Predict using the saved model: ```>> python predict.py```

Sample for keras implemntation of hyperparametrization using hyperopt for MLP regression model.<br/>
This block of code also demonstrates how to save trained model in json and h5 formats.

Prereq package: ```hyperopt```<br/>
Install using ```pip``` (```pip install hyperopt```) or using ```conda``` (see installation guide).

To train the MLP and save the model: ```>> python main.py```

Predict using the saved model: ```>> python predict.py```
